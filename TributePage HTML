            <h2 class="heads">Death of the beloved Paul Walker</h2>
            <p class="death">"If one day the speed kills me, don't cry. Because I was smiling."</p>
            <p>On November 30, 2013, at approximately 3:30 p.m. PST, Walker and Roger Rodas, 38, left an event for Walker's charity Reach Out Worldwide
                for victims of Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in Rodas's red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT. The car crashed into a concrete lamppost and two trees
                on Hercules Street, in a 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) speed zone near Kelly Johnson Parkway in Valencia, Santa Clarita, California, 
                after which the vehicle burst into flames. The crash was caught on film by a security camera. Authorities determined that Rodas was 
                driving the car while Walker was the passenger. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department declared both victims dead at the scene.
                Rodas died of multiple traumatic injuries while Walker died from the combined effects of traumatic and thermal trauma, according to 
                the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. Both of their bodies were burned beyond recognition.</p>
            <p>The curve where Walker and Rodas were killed is a popular spot for drifting cars. The coroner's report stated that the 2005 Porsche Carrera
                GT was traveling at a speed possibly as high as 100 miles per hour (160 km/h) before the crash. The coroner's report further stated that no
                alcohol or other drugs were found in the systems of either man. Furthermore, it states that there were no hints of technical problems with 
                the car and neither a damaged surface of the street nor parts on the street played a role in the crash. Police investigated as to whether 
                drag racing played a role but were unable to find evidence of a second car's involvement. A piece of the car was stolen off the tow truck as
                the wreckage was towed away on a flatbed. Two men, Jameson Brooks Witty and Anthony Janow, were arrested for grand theft.</p>
            <p>
                Walker's autopsy showed "scant soot" in his trachea, leading investigators to believe he died before the car was engulfed in fire,
                where Rodaswas killed on or shortly after impact by head, neck, and chest trauma.
                In March 2014, further investigation revealed that the speed of the car was the main reason for the crash. The car was said to be
                traveling between 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) and 93 miles per hour (150 km/h) and had nine-year-old tires that were seldom driven on.
                With Furious 7 in the middle of filming at the time of Walker's death, Universal announced an indeterminate hiatus on the production,
                citing a desire to speak with his family before determining what to do with the film.
                Numerous friends and movie stars posted tributes to Walker on social media. His body was cremated and his ashes were buried in a
                non-denominational ceremony at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.
                In December 2014, Walker's father, Paul III, filed a lawsuit against Rodas's estate seeking the return of or "a proportionate share" 
                of revenue generated by a group of automobiles that were jointly owned by both Walker and Rodas.
            </p>  
            <p>
                In September 2015, Walker's daughter Meadow filed a suit against Porsche for wrongful death of her father, claiming that the Porsche 
                Carrera GT had numerous design defects including a history of instability, and that seat belt placement can cause harm upon impact.
                Porsche's response denied any wrongdoing and blamed Walker himself, stating: "The perils, risk, and danger were open and obvious and 
                known to him, and he chose to conduct himself in a manner so as to expose himself to such perils, dangers, and risks, thus assuming
                all the risks involved in using the vehicle." In April 2016, a U.S. District Court ruled in favor of Porsche in a separate lawsuit 
                filed by Roger Rodas' widow, Kristine. The ruling has no bearing on two other cases against Porsche which have been filed by Walker's
                father, who is also the executor of the actor's estate, and his daughter. Both are pending cases at the Los Angeles superior court.
